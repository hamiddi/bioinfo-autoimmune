# Bioinformatics of Autoimmune Diseases
This repository provides the source code, scripts, and usage instructions that serve as supplementary materials for the book **_Bioinformatics of Autoimmune Diseases_**. It is designed to support reproducibility and hands-on learning by offering practical examples, data analysis pipelines, and tools discussed throughout the chapters.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories corresponding to chapters in the book:

- `ch4/` – Bioinformatics Databases  
- `ch5/` – RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq and Small RNA-Seq)  
- `ch6/` – Variant Analysis  
- `ch7/` – ChIP-Seq for DNA-Protein Interaction  
- `ch8/` – ATAC-Seq for Autoimmune Diseases  
- `ch9/` – Amplicon-Based and Shotgun-Based Metagenomics Data Analysis  

Each chapter contains relevant code, scripts, and setup instructions.

## System Requirements and Setup

Before running the code, please ensure the following:

- A Linux-based system is strongly recommended, preferably a high-performance computing (HPC) environment.
- Sufficient memory and storage capacity to process large datasets.
- All required software and packages must be installed as noted in the comments within each script.
- It is recommended to create a separate [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) environment for each chapter to manage dependencies cleanly.

## Data and Resources

- Download the example raw data using the provided scripts located in the `data/raw/` directory.
- Reference genomes, annotation files, and databases should be downloaded and configured as described in the corresponding book chapters.
- Ensure you update file paths in the scripts to reflect your local setup.

## Stay Updated

Check this repository periodically for updates, bug fixes, and additional resources.
