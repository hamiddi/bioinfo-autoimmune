This Python script renames FASTQ files that follow the Illumina CASAVA 1.8+ naming convention 
(e.g., `sample1_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz`) into a simpler, cleaner format 
(e.g., `sample1_1.fastq.gz` and `sample1_2.fastq.gz`). This renaming helps standardize filenames 
for easier downstream processing in bioinformatics pipelines.

Required Python Packages:
- os
- re

Input:
- FASTQ files located in a target directory (default: `data/raw`)
- Expected filename pattern: `{sampleID}_S##_L###_R[12]_001.fastq.gz`

Output:
- Renamed FASTQ files using the format `{sampleID}_1.fastq.gz` and `{sampleID}_2.fastq.gz`
- Original files are renamed in place

Usage:
Run the script as a standalone utility to rename all matching FASTQ files:
```bash
python rename_fastq_files.py

Note:
Update the target_directory variable if your FASTQ files are in a different location.
This script assumes all files are single-lane, paired-end reads with CASAVA formatting.
